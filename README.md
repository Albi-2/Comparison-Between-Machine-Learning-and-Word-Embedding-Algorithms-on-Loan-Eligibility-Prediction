Comparison Between Machine Learning and Word Embedding Algorithms on Loan Eligibility Prediction

This repository contains the code used in the thesis "Comparison Between Machine Learning and Word Embedding Algorithms on Loan Eligibility Prediction".

Project Overview:
The study evaluates the performance of Word Embedding techniques (Word2Vec, FastText) against traditional machine learning models on loan eligibility prediction. The models are tested on two datasets: the Statlog (German Credit Dataset) and LendingClub Dataset. Various evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) and data balancing techniques are applied, with a focus on identifying bad loans.
